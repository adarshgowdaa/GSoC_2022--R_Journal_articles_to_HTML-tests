**Abstract** A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics, based on 
"The Grammar of Graphics". You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2' how to 
map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it 
takes care of the details. 
 
# Introduction 
 
Interactive data graphics provides plots that allow users to interact 
them. One of the most basic types of interaction is through tooltips, 
where users are provided additional information about elements in the 
plot by moving the cursor over the plot. 
 
This paper will first review some R packages on interactive graphics and 
their tooltip implementations. A new package 
[ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) that provides 
customized tooltips for plot, is introduced. Some example plots will 
then be given to showcase how these tooltips help users to better read 
the graphics. 
 
# Background 
 
Some packages on interactive graphics include 
[plotly](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=plotly) [@plotly] that 
interfaces with Javascript for web-based interactive graphics, 
[crosstalk](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=crosstalk) [@crosstalk] 
that specializes cross-linking elements across individual graphics. The 
recent R Journal paper 
[tsibbletalk](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsibbletalk) 
[@RJ-2021-050] provides a good example of including interactive graphics 
into an article for the journal. It has both a set of linked plots, and 
also an animated gif example, illustrating linking between time series 
plots and feature summaries. 
 
# Customizing tooltip design with ToOoOlTiPs {#customizing-tooltip-design-with} 
 
ggplot2 is a packages for customizing tooltips in interactive graphics, 
it features these possibilities.

The [palmerpenguins](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=palmerpenguins) 
data [@palmerpenguins] features three penguin species which has a lovely
